CS 181 Practical 4: Reinforcement Learning

Group: Kavya Kopparapu, Franklyn Wang, Kody Stremick

Our main code is located in the various versions of stub: 'stub_Kavya_Franklyn_Corrected.py', 'stub_version_1.py', and 'stub_version_2.py'.

Our Q-matrices after learning for N epochs are located in various files named 'Q_matrix_iteration_editedvalues_N.npy'.

Our stub versions contain code for loading Q matrices from these .npy files in the 'run_games' function.
